####How I discovered my interest in coding

I was working for my dad in a basically dead-end job, at a car dealership in which I had no interest in. I was bored one day and decided to look up some HTML tutorials, when I stumbled across [this site](www.htmlcodetutorial.com) three days later and I had a mostly functioning website for a blog I was working on.

#####About me

I love to game and love learning new things, especially when it comes to programming or anything regarding technology really.

I have a twitter account........I just don't know what it is because I really never used it.
